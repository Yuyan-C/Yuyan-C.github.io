# Reading group & study group
- I participate in [Equity in Math Reading Club](https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/channels/event/equity-math-reading-club-329582). [Topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UfT0H9dt2QTEkmg3MYfZsQnc6dIV8WnTeQK5gbcok18/edit#heading=h.intmlfnxg6kr) we have discussed include imposter syndrome, academic integrity and fairness, math anxiety, white supremacy, and indigenous mathematics.

- I attend the weekly study session of the [Anishinaabe Language Study Group](https://www.instagram.com/anishinaabe_mcgill/) to learn the Ojibwe language.

- I joined in [Diversity in Math](https://diversityinmath.ssmu.ca/) reading group in Summer 2022, where we read *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* by Paulo Freire, *Educated* by Tara Westover, and *Weapons of Math Destruction* by Cathy O'Neil.
