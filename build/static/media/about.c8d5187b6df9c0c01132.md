# Intro

<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, supervised by [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). My research interest is in machine learning and computer vision, especially applying them to climate change and biodiversity. I'm currently working on insect monitoring and new species detection with camera-trap images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also obtained my B.Sc. from McGill in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program, with a minor in Environment. </p>
