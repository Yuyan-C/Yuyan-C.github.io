We deployed camera traps in the forest to collect long-term data on moths and to discover new species. Like on BCI, the biodiversity was incredible. I loved getting to work closely with entomologists and software engineers and seeing the whole pipeline from data collection in the field to verifying machine predictions. It was a really valuable interdisciplinary experience that shaped how I think about my research. I’m grateful for their support, and for the local staff, who are truly indispensable for long-term data collection.
