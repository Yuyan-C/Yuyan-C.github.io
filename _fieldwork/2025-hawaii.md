This fieldwork was part of an amazing interdisciplinary course, [Experiential Introduction to AI and Ecology](https://imageomics.osu.edu/news/2024/06/imageomics-institute-launches-new-ai-ecology-course), offered by the Ohio State University. 

We deployed camera traps and microphones to record long-term bird activity in the Puʻu Makaʻala Natural Area Reserve and conducted drone surveys of the restored forest.
