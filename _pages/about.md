I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en), supervised by Prof. [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). My research focuses on machine learning for biodiversity monitoring.

I obtained my B.Sc. from McGill in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program, with a minor in Environment.
