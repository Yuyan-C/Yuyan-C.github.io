# Intro

I am a first-year Master student in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, supervised by [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). My primary research interest is in machine learning and computer vision, especially applying them to climate change and biodiversity. I'm currently working on moth monitoring and new species detection with camera-trap images.

I also obtained my B.Sc. from McGill in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program, with a minor in Environment. My favorite courses during my undergrad include Machine Learning Applied to Climate Change, Fundamentals of Computer Vision, Society, Environment and Sustainability, Linear Algebra, PDE, and Statistics.
