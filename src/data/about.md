# Intro

<p>I am a first-year Master student in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, supervised by [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). My primary research interest is in machine learning and computer vision, especially applying them to climate change and biodiversity. I'm currently working on moth monitoring and new species detection with camera-trap images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also obtained my B.Sc. from McGill in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program, with a minor in Environment. During my undergrad, I worked on projects related to calcium diffusion in astrocytes, land cover type classification, topic modeling, and machine learning storage. Besides machine learning and environment, I'm also interested in equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM education. I participate in [Equity in Math Reading Club](https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/channels/event/equity-math-reading-club-329582), where we discuss issues of EDI in math education.</p>
