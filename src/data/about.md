# Intro

I am a first-year Master student in Computer Science at McGill University, supervised by David Rolnick. My primary research interest is in machine learning and computer vision, especially applying them to climate change and biodiversity. I also obtained my B.Sc. from McGill in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program, with a minor in Environment.
